# AI-vs-Human-Detection-
Built an AI vs Human text detection system using a balanced 150K dataset. Applied preprocessing, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and trained ML &amp; deep models, selecting a BiLSTM with ~99.5% accuracy. Integrated LIME for explainable AI and deployed an interactive Streamlit app for real-time prediction and word-level explanation.
